      <h2>Computer Science & Engineering(CSE)</h2>
      <h4>Computer Science and Engineering program. It is a popular branch among students and offers decent job opportunities after graduation. I will provide information such as- basic course details, course duration, eligibility criteria, important subjects present, courses to do after Graduation, scope and job opportunities.</h4>      
      <p>Students who are interested in programming, software development, computer science and have good analytical and reasoning skills may pursue this course. B.C.A.
